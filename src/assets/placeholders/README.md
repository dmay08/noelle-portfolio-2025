# Placeholder Assets Directory

This directory is for placeholder image and video assets that will be replaced with actual media files during development.

## Structure
- Each project has corresponding placeholder files for thumbnails, images, and videos
- File naming follows the pattern: `[project-id]-[asset-type].[extension]`
- Example: `google-woocommerce-thumb.jpg`, `doordash-creator-feature.jpg`, etc.

## Asset Types
- `thumb.jpg`: Project thumbnail images (used in grid)
- `main.jpg/mp4`: Main project images/videos
- `feature.jpg`: Feature images for media text blocks
- `video-thumb.jpg`: Thumbnail/poster images for videos
- `q1.jpg, q2.jpg, q3.jpg, q4.jpg`: Quadrant images (used in quadrant blocks)

## Usage Notes
- Replace these placeholders with actual media assets as they become available
- Maintain the same file names when replacing to avoid breaking references
- Ensure all media is properly optimized for web (compressed, appropriate resolution)
